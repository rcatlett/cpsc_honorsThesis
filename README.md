#To get the NBA dataframe, download all the raw data for the NBA from dougstats (already uploaded), proceed to run the formatfiles.R on it (it will look for ALL y*.csv files in your global environment - may be a better way to do that) and then run the getNBA.R file on the resulting csv files. This will clear your environment of all items it produces save the NBA data frame.
